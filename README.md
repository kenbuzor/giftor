## Overview

This is a random-picker app. It can be useful for the random selection of who to gift an item to.

In fact, this idea was born from the complexity of sharing gifts among a particular group I was part of in my place of worship. We intended to have everyone write their name in a piece of paper so we can spin and randomly select a secret recipient, but unfortunately we were unable to get everyone to be physically present, so I decided to build an app to help with that.
